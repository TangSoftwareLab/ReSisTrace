This repository contains the data analysis codes for the ReSisTrace project.

All codes for data process and analysis are saved in folder "codes/". 

Some steps are performed on a cluster server. Those scripts are saved in the directory "codes/codes_on_server/".

The codes for generating the figures in the manuscript are saved in the RMarkdown file "codes/Figures_for_ReSisTrace_manuscript.Rmd".

As the scripts were run under different repositories, the file paths might be inconsistent in different scripts.
